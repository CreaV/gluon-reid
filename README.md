# gluon-reid
A code gallery for person re-identification with mxnet-gluon, and I will reproduce many STOA algorithm.
Now, I only reproduce 5 papers, and train the model on marktet1501. I will add other datasets later. 
I also will make further adjustments on these models. Before the end of August, all of these models and codes will be released.
